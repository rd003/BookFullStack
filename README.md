# BookFullStack

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0 and `json-server` (as a backend).

📝 note: I made it as a practise project for ngrx and rxjs. It may contain very bad practices. If any one using it use with caution. Reviews are most welcome and would be benificial for growing as a better angular dev.

## How to run it?

 👉 `ng serve --open` for a dev server.
 👉 `npm run server` to start api server.
