# BookFullStack

This project is made with `Angular 16.0.0` and `json-server` (as a backend).

📝 note: I made it as a practice project for ngrx and rxjs. It may contain very bad practices. If any one using it use with caution. Reviews are most welcome and would be benificial for growing as a better angular dev.

## How to run it?

 👉 `ng serve --open` for a dev server.
 👉 `npm run server` to start api server.
